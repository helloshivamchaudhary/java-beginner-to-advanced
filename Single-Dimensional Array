A single-dimensional array in Java is a collection of elements of the same data type that are arranged in a single row. The elements in the array are accessed using their index, which starts from 0 and goes up to the length of the array minus one.

To declare and initialize a single-dimensional array, you can use the syntax data_type[] array_name = new data_type[array_size];, where data_type is the data type of the elements in the array, array_name is the name you want to give to the array, and array_size is the number of elements you want to store in the array. For example, int[] myArray = new int[5]; creates an array of integers with five elements.
